I followed along with this Vue [tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue/). In the gh-pages branch, I am trying (not successful yet) to deploy a build to GitHub pages. The branch has a vue.config.js file which contains the publicPath of my GitHub.

# vue-app

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production. This outputs the dist folder. 
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
